# Interaction Logger

Overview

Interaction Logger is a simple Ethereum smart contract that allows users to log their interactions with a timestamp. Each interaction emits an event that can be tracked on the blockchain.

Features

Logs interactions with the sender's address and timestamp.

Uses events for efficient logging.

No storage or constructors, making it lightweight and gas-efficient.

Smart Contract Code

The contract is written in Solidity and can be found in InteractionLogger.sol.

Deployment

Compile the contract using Remix with Solidity version 0.8.x.

Deploy it on an Ethereum-compatible network using Remix or Hardhat.

Copy the deployed contract address and replace <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> below.

Contract Address

<CONTRACT_ADDRESS> 0x6B0889077f6Cbc5E46407e221cbF5592a5b1d733

How to Use

Call the logInteraction function to log an event.

Monitor events using blockchain explorers like Etherscan or with Web3 libraries.
